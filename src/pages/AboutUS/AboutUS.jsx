                At the heart of our restaurant’s vision and success is Erik
                Arshakyan, our Owner and Executive Chef. With a lifelong passion
                for the culinary arts and a deep appreciation for diverse global
                cuisines, Erik brings creativity, skill, and soul to every dish
                that leaves our kitchen. Trained in both classical and modern
                culinary techniques, Erik has spent years mastering the flavors
                of Europe, Asia, and the Mediterranean. His journey through
                world-renowned kitchens has shaped a unique culinary identity
                that blends tradition with innovation. As a leader, Erik is
                hands-on, passionate, and deeply committed to excellence — not
                just in the food, but in the entire dining experience. His
                philosophy is simple: cook with heart, serve with pride, and
                always exceed expectations. Under his guidance, our restaurant
                has become a place where food tells a story, and guests feel
                like family.
